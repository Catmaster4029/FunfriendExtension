# FunfriendExtension
funfreind :3:3:3:3

work in progress extension for chrome and chromium which uses corru's buddy script to appear in all webpages! sometimes it can get a lil buggy, and some webpages (like google docs) will automatically not make it spawn.

if you want to install it, enable developer mode on the "extensions" tab for chrome, and load unpacked.
